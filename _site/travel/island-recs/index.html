<p>We set up a 4 hour (2.5 hours on the water) kayak tour with <a href="https://sea-quest-kayak.com/">SeaQuest Kayak Tours</a> for our wedding guests (unfortunately we won’t be able to join since we’ll be on a family whale watch) on Friday, August 9th from 10:30 am - 2:30 pm. It’s $147 a person (with taxes and 6% credit card fee) and you can <a href="https://fareharbor.com/embeds/book/sea-quest-kayak/items/409408/availability/1486395850/book/?full-items=yes">sign up at this link</a>. Make sure you mention you are on the custom tour with Ira’s wedding. Please note: the link says 10:30 - 1:30, but that’s just a system limitation on their end.</p>

<p>If you are interested in a <a href="https://sea-quest-kayak.com/kayaking-san-juan-islands/bioluminescence-kayak-tours/">bioluminescent tour</a> or longer <a href="https://sea-quest-kayak.com/kayaking-san-juan-islands/1-day-san-juan-kayaking-trips/">6 hour tour</a> (which they highly recommend) please feel free to sign up for that instead!</p>

<h4 id="the-rest-of-the-island">The rest of the island</h4>
<p>We’ll take the rest of our sightseeing cues from <a href="https://www.visitsanjuans.com/san-juan-islands-scenic-byway-route-2011.pdf">San Juan Island’s Scenic Byway</a>, which circumnavigates most of the island:</p>

<p>From Friday Harbor, head south to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/JwLuWVvNnQpYr64r7">American Camp at San Juan Island National Historical Park</a>. This park is huge with forests, beaches, and prairies to explore. You’ll likely spot some bald eagles and red foxes while you’re there!</p>

<p>Next, head west to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CmaC7JhZvStNMUUm6">Lime Kiln Point State Park</a> (aka Whale Watch Park). This is a scenic spot that is supposedly one of the best places to see whales from shore (we have yet to do so, but feeling lucky for 2024)!</p>

<p>Continue north toward Roche Harbor, with options to stop at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dNw6T6mVzRtCh9NQA">Krystal Acres Alpaca Farm</a> (for petting cute alpacas), <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZbZfFLTJ1riuSveYA">English Camp</a> (a smaller part of San Juan Island National Historical Park, but equally interesting for history of the <a href="https://www.strawberriesandoysters.com/more/">Pig War</a>), and the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/TNZmM1aEs8P29gAu6">Sculpture Park at Westcott Bay</a> (a quirky, artsy spot to stretch your legs just outside of Roche Harbor). Additionally, along this route is <a href="https://www.westcottbayshellfish.com/">Westcott Bay Shellfish Co.</a>, a delightful place to spend the afternoon, eating seafood and sipping cold beverages.</p>

<p>place to load up on road trip (or bike ride!) snacks. If you’re there on a Saturday or Sunday and like cider or gin, we also recommend a tasting at <a href="https://www.sanjuanislanddistillery.com/?utm_source=VisitSanJuans&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=VisitSanJuans%20Referral">San Juan Island Distillery</a>. They also do tastings on Fridays if you just let them know in advance!</p>

<p>If you’re feeling adventurous and want to stretch your legs again, there is also a tiny, adorable county park on the northeastern side of the island called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/gK33Ks7xAiLjEQXV7">Reuben Tarte County Park</a>. We recommend it as a picnic location and, potentially, whale watching (we saw whales here last time we were on SJI)!</p>

<p>Head back south toward Friday Harbor to conclude your tour of the island. If you need to stock up on libations, we suggest a stop at <a href="https://www.sanjuanvineyard.com/">San Juan Vineyard</a> (also where Aleta’s sister Ara celebrated her engagement over 20 years ago)!</p>
