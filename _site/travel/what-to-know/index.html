<p>Cue the planes, trains, boats and automobiles!! San Juan Island is located in the northwest corner of Washington State – in fact, you can see Canada from our wedding venue. Our goal is for your travel here to be as painless (and fun!!) as possible. We love an adventure – especially when it involves island hopping – and we hope you do too. So, we plan to be in touch early and often about travel and accommodations for the wedding.</p>

<p><strong>The most important thing</strong>: if you plan to attend the wedding (or are pretty sure you may be able to come, or are even thinking about joining us), it is important to book your accommodations as soon as possible.</p>

<p>San Juan Island is a small community with limited hotels, bed and breakfasts, and AirBNBs / VRBOs. We will be in touch over email with a detailed list of places to stay and provide additional updates on this page. We recommend taking a look at the options on the island and booking a place that is in your price range for your preferred dates early. Most places on the island have flexible cancellation policies since it is so popular for summer travel.</p>
