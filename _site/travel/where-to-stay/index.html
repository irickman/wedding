<p>San Juan Island is a small community with limited hotels, bed and breakfasts, and AirBNBs / VRBOs. We will be in touch over email with a detailed list of places to stay and provide additional updates on this page. We recommend taking a look at the options on the island and booking a place that is in your price range for your preferred dates early. Most places on the island have flexible cancellation policies since it is so popular for summer travel.</p>

<p><strong>The most important thing</strong>: if you plan to attend the wedding (or are pretty sure you may be able to come, or are even <em>thinking</em> about joining us), it is important to book your accommodations as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Our venue, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/xVvPcQgtesfrEC8f7">Saltwater Farm</a>, is located just outside of Friday Harbor, Washington. We recommend staying in or near Friday Harbor to minimize commute time to various activities. There are a limited number of two person Airstreams available for rent and an option to camp as well, otherwise San Juan Island is relatively small and full of hidden gems, so searching farther afield can be fun too!</p>

<p>Often this is where you’d see a room block or something similar, but San Juan Island doesn’t have many options with room blocks. We’re working to see if some of the smaller hotels or bed and breakfasts may be able to offer a room block for us — that said, our sense is that this group of well-seasoned travelers may have more fun looking for and booking accommodations separately which is why we’re intentionally being a little open-ended here.</p>

<p>We are very happy to help folks search for places to stay and hope to add more resources in the next month but wanted to start by encouraging you to explore first. In the meantime, the San Juan Island Visitors Bureau has a <a href="https://www.visitsanjuans.com/stay-san-juan-island">comprehensive list</a> of places to stay on San Juan Island.</p>
