<p>If you’re staying in Friday Harbor, there is a lot to do that does not require a car. There is a <a href="https://www.sanjuantransit.com/schedules.html">bus</a> on the island as well as <a href="https://susiesmopeds.com/">moped</a> and bike rentals that can transport you between sights fairly seamlessly.</p>

<p><strong>There is very limited taxi service and no rideshare service. If you are interested in using a taxi, please let us know so that we can help you make a reservation.</strong></p>

<p>However, if you are staying outside of Friday Harbor, it likely will be helpful to have a set of wheels, such as a car or bike to get between places. Again, we’re happy to help set up carpools too!</p>
