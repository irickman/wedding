        <h2 id="what-to-know"> What To Know</h2>
        <p> <p>Cue the planes, trains, boats and automobiles!! San Juan Island is located in the northwest corner of Washington State – in fact, you can see Canada from our wedding venue. Our goal is for your travel here to be as painless (and fun!!) as possible. We love an adventure – especially when it involves island hopping – and we hope you do too. So, we plan to be in touch early and often about travel and accommodations for the wedding.</p>

<p><strong>The most important thing</strong>: if you plan to attend the wedding (or are pretty sure you may be able to come, or are even thinking about joining us), it is important to book your accommodations as soon as possible.</p>

<p>San Juan Island is a small community with limited hotels, bed and breakfasts, and AirBNBs / VRBOs. We will be in touch over email with a detailed list of places to stay and provide additional updates on this page. We recommend taking a look at the options on the island and booking a place that is in your price range for your preferred dates early. Most places on the island have flexible cancellation policies since it is so popular for summer travel.</p>
 </p>
        <div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="row justify-content-center">    
    <div class="col-lg-8">
        <h2 id="where-to-stay"> Where To Stay</h2>
        <p> <p>Our venue, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/xVvPcQgtesfrEC8f7">Saltwater Farm</a>, is located just outside of Friday Harbor, Washington. We recommend staying in or near Friday Harbor to minimize commute time to various activities. There are a limited number of two person Airstreams available for rent on property as well, but San Juan Island is relatively small and full of hidden gems, so searching farther afield can be fun too!</p>

<p>Often this is where you’d see a room block or something similar, but San Juan Island doesn’t have a lot of options that provide that service. We’re working to see if some of the smaller hotels or bed and breakfasts may be able to offer a room block for us — that said, our sense is that this group of well-seasoned travelers may have more fun looking for and booking accommodations separately which is why we’re intentionally being a little open-ended here.</p>

<p>We are very happy to help folks search for places to stay and hope to add more resources in the next month but wanted to start by encouraging you to explore first. In the meantime, the San Juan Island Visitors Bureau has a <a href="https://www.visitsanjuans.com/stay-san-juan-island">comprehensive list</a> of places to stay on San Juan Island.</p>
 </p>
        <div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>

  </div>
  
  <div class="row justify-content-center">    
    <div class="col-lg-8">
        <h2 id="getting-there"> Getting There</h2>
        <p> <p>OK, now that your accommodations are sorted, let’s talk about getting to the island. Like booking accommodations, travel to San Juan Island is best reserved in advance (just not quite as far in advance).</p>

<p>If you’re traveling from out of state, you can fly into SeaTac (Seattle/Tacoma) or Paine Field (Everett). SeaTac is the larger of the two airports with the widest array of flight options. Paine Field is much smaller but technically closer to the venue. We may recommend flying through SeaTac to ensure that any travel issues can be mitigated more quickly, but Paine Field may be a good option for folks who are able to fly directly there.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: If you are flying into Washington, we suggest arriving by Thursday, August 8 and departing late Sunday, August 11 — or even Monday, August 12. From either airport, it is still a lengthy drive and an hourlong boat ride or a short second flight to get to and from San Juan Island. We’d love for you to avoid travel stress while you’re here for our wedding!</p>

<p>If you are coming in from out of town, you may want a rental car if you are planning to do more than attend wedding activities. We also are hoping to organize shuttles as needed/appropriate – more to come on that.</p>

<p>Once you’re on the ground in Washington, there are a few options to get to San Juan Island:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ferry</strong>: Our preferred way to get to San Juan Island is via Washington State Ferry which requires getting to Anacortes, Washington (about 1.5 hours north of Seattle, depending on traffic – via car or shuttle) where you can walk, bike, or drive on to the ferry.
    <ul>
      <li><em>Walk on</em>: If you are comfortable walking on to the ferry, you just need to get to Anacortes. We are happy to help organize carpools or there is also a <a href="https://airporter.com/shuttle/schedules/anacortes-san-juan-islands/">shuttle</a> that picks up at both airports and downtown Seattle. You can also bike on to the ferry (like we did back in 2021). Again, we’re happy to coordinate carpools for luggage or people if you decide to walk or bike. You do not need an advance reservation if you plan to walk on or bike on to the ferry (though you will need to arrive prior to your preferred sailing time to buy a ticket).</li>
      <li><em>Drive on</em>: <strong>If you plan to drive on to the ferry, you WILL need a <a href="https://secureapps.wsdot.wa.gov/Ferries/Reservations/Vehicle/default.aspx">reservation</a></strong>. Washington State Ferry reservations become available at 7 am PT in blocks released two months, two weeks, and two days prior to sailing. We will be in touch via email, text, and on this very website with the when, how, and what if you rent a car.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Plane</strong>: Perhaps the most scenic way to get to San Juan Island is by airplane. You can take a small plane from SeaTac or Paine Field directly to Friday Harbor Airport (FHR) or you can also take a <a href="https://kenmoreair.com/">float plane</a> (!) from a variety of locations in and around Seattle to Friday Harbor.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Potential boat from downtown</em></strong>: There MAY be a direct boat option to San Juan Island from Seattle (service was discontinued during 2020, but may return in 2024) – we will be in touch on that option if it becomes available.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="row justify-content-center">    
    <div class="col-lg-8">
        <h2 id="how-to-get-around"> How To Get Around</h2>
        <p> <p>If you’re staying in Friday Harbor, there is a lot to do that does not require a car. There is a <a href="https://www.sanjuantransit.com/schedules.html">bus</a> on the island as well as <a href="https://susiesmopeds.com/">moped</a> and bike rentals that can transport you between sights fairly seamlessly.</p>

<p><strong>There is very limited taxi service and no rideshare service. If you are interested in using a taxi, please let us know so that we can help you make a reservation.</strong></p>

<p>However, if you are staying outside of Friday Harbor, it may help to have a set of wheels, such as a car or bike, to get between places. Again, we’re happy to help set up carpools too!</p>

        <p> <p>San Juan Island is a summer paradise! We’ll have wedding-related events and activities on the island Friday, August 9 through Sunday, August 11. We’re a bit biased, but we love this area and if you have some time to explore San Juan Island (SJI) or the rest of the PNW, we encourage you to add a few days to your trip on either end. We have lots of ideas about how to travel in Washington! Read more below for some of our recommendations, based on the amount of time you have to spend on vacation.</p>

<h4 id="just-a-long-weekend">Just a long weekend</h4>
<p>If you’re only able to travel for the wedding, let’s focus on San Juan Island (SJI). First, make sure your travel plans are squared away so that you can maximize time on the island. Here are some of our SJI highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In Friday Harbor, we’ve enjoyed bites from San Juan Island Brewing, Bakery San Juan, and Crow’s Nest Coffee Shop. We’re hoping to add to this list as we make visits up to SJI for wedding planning over the next year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’ll take our sightseeing cues from <a href="https://www.visitsanjuans.com/san-juan-islands-scenic-byway-route-2011.pdf">San Juan Island’s Scenic Byway</a>, which circumnavigates most of the island:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>From Friday Harbor, head south to American Camp at San Juan Island National  Historical Park. This park is huge with forests, beaches, and prairies to explore.</li>
      <li>Next, head west to Lime Kiln Point State Park (aka Whale Watch Park). This is a scenic spot that is supposedly one of the best places to see whales from shore (we have yet to do so, but feeling lucky for 2024!). On the way to Lime Kiln State Park, you may want to stop at Pelindaba Lavender Farm &amp; Gatehouse Store, if you’re feeling flowery.</li>
      <li>Continue north toward Roche Harbor, with options to stop at Krystal Acres Alpaca Farm (for petting cute alpacas), English Camp (a smaller part of San Juan Island National Historical Park, but equally interesting for history of the <a href="https://www.strawberriesandoysters.com/more/">Pig War</a>), and the Sculpture Park at Westcott Bay (a quirky artsy spot to stretch your legs just outside of Roche Harbor). Roche Harbor is primarily a marina (great for yacht spotting!) and a solid place to load up on road trip (or bike ride!) snacks.  If you’re there on a Saturday or Sunday and like cider or gin, we also recommend a tasting at <a href="https://www.sanjuanislanddistillery.com/?utm_source=VisitSanJuans&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=VisitSanJuans%20Referral">San Juan Island Distillery</a>.</li>
      <li>Head back southwest toward Friday Harbor to conclude your tour of the island. If you need to stock up on libations, we suggest a stop at San Juan Island Winery (also where Aleta’s sister Ara celebrated her engagement over 20 years ago!).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fully-unplugged">Fully unplugged</h4>
<p>If you want to tack on a few days on either end of the celebrations, here are a few additional ideas of places to explore nearby:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you’re flying through Seattle, it may be worth taking a day to see some of our favorite Seattle sites:
    <ul>
      <li>Pike Place Market (we endorse stops at Beecher’s Handmade Cheese and Rachel’s Ginger Beer - only go order at the first Starbucks if you feel it will complete your life)</li>
      <li>The Chihuly Museum at the base of the Space Needle</li>
      <li>Local parks (our favorites are Discovery Park and Seward Park - both of which feature views of Mt. Rainier on clear days)</li>
      <li>Local beaches (fun fact: Aleta thought everyone wore jackets to the beach until she was 10 because of the weather in the PNW - our favorites are Golden Gardens in Ballard and Alki in West Seattle)</li>
      <li>Local-ish hikes (there’s a wide range of hikes within 60 minutes of Seattle by car - let us know if you want a recommendation or check out the <a href="https://www.wta.org/go-outside/map">Washington Trails Association</a> to find one)</li>
      <li>Any Seattle brewery (our favorites are Fair Isle and Lucky Envelope in the Ballard Brewery district and Holy Mountain in Greenwood or Interbay)<br />
<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you have a hankering to see other islands in the San Juan archipelago, there is ferry service to other islands in the San Juans:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Lopez Island</em>: Very quiet island with several parks and a handful of eateries/bakeries. This would be a great place to unplug for a few days and really relax.</li>
      <li><em>Orcas Island</em>: More touristy, this island has some incredible restaurants (Matia and Monti!), beautiful parks (Moran State Park), great accommodations and many of the same island activities as SJI – just with a different island flair.     <br />
<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you’re familiar with Seattle and want to go further afield, we may suggest some outdoor explorations:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Mount Rainier National Park (southeast of Seattle)</em>: This is doable in a long day, but doubly worth it if you can plan an overnight pitstop too. We recommend a loop from Seattle - driving south to Sunrise Lodge and then on to Paradise Lodge. There are good short trails from both lodges that showcase good mountain views and wildflowers!</li>
      <li><em>North Cascades National Park (northeast of Seattle)</em>: A bit north, North Cascades National Park is a hidden gem (and one of the least visited national parks in America!!). We love this park – in part because it’s so remote. This is an excellent place to do a scenic drive (seriously Highway 20 is beautiful!) or any serious hiking, backpacking, and/or boating (on Diablo or Ross Lakes).</li>
      <li><em>Olympic National Park (west of Seattle)</em>: You could spend several days exploring this park because there is a lot to see – the park has mountains, forests, and beaches. Key pitstops include: Hurricane Ridge, Crescent Lake, Hoh Rainforest (one of the largest temperate rainforests in the US), and beaches galore (Rialto, Second Beach - where we got engaged, Third Beach, and Ruby Beach are some Greer family favorites).</li>
      <li><em>Mt. St. Helens (south of Seattle and a National Volcanic Monument - not a national park!)</em>: Cool to see a volcano that erupted so recently! This is in the opposite direction of the wedding venue, but doable if you’re interested in seeing the SW part of the state and have some extra time or if you decide to fly in through Portland. Ira ran around this during a 50k race in 2022 - you can do that too if you want but a warning that it is hard.</li>
      <li><em>Mt. Baker - Snoqualmie National Forest (northeast from Seattle)</em>: If you were hoping that we’d have another volcano suggestion, you’re in luck! Mt. Baker is another gorgeous area to explore, especially if you’re looking for a place to hike that is closer (relatively speaking) to the wedding. Most access points are close to Bellingham if you’re looking to pair some outdoor exploring with a home base for a few days.<br />
<br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you’re more of an indoor cat, we may suggest some city/town explorations:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Bellingham, WA (north of Seattle)</em>: This is a chill town north of Seattle that is right on the water, looking out at the San Juan Islands and Canada. It’s known for its breweries, views, vibes, and cute shops.</li>
      <li><em>Leavenworth, WA (east of Seattle)</em>: If you were hoping we’d get married in Germany, please add Leavenworth to your itinerary. Nestled in the Cascades, Leavenworth is a cute and kitschy town that takes its stylistic cues from Bavaria – doable as an overnight or as a stop on the way to explore the eastern part of the state. Nice food, cute shops, and excellent access to the outdoors are all featured here.</li>
      <li><em>Vancouver or Victoria, Canada (north of Seattle)</em>: If you’re open to making this an international trip (really!), we strongly encourage a trip to Vancouver and/or Victoria. We’re doing them a disservice by looping them together here since they are wildly different cities with a lot to offer - and they’re separated by a lot of water. Go to Vancouver to see an international city with world class food, fascinating first nations history, and great city parks. Check out Victoria for high tea (at the Empress), harbor tours, and - again - excellent food.</li>
      <li><em>Portland, OR (south of Seattle)</em>: We couldn’t miss a chance to shout out one of the best food cities in America (in our opinion): PDX. Come for the food, stay for the zany airport carpet (kidding - kinda), great city parks, cool art, and adorable independent shops.</li>
