            <h2 id="how-we-became-pals">How We Became Pals</h2>

<p>Aleta and Ira met one preternaturally cold morning in April 2016 before the George Washington Parkway Classic, an annual 10 mile run that takes place between Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington, and Old Town Alexandria, in the northern Virginia suburbs. Aleta planned to run with some friends from Georgetown (hello, Connor, Meredith, Michelle, and Patrick!! They’ll be at the wedding), and Ira was planning to run with some coworkers (that’d be Connor). Naturally, this group of twentysomethings gathered to keep warm and chat ahead of the race. Aleta and Ira were introduced, Ira promptly declared his dislike for Aleta’s running group, and Aleta decided he was her mortal enemy.</p>

<p>During the race, both Aleta and Ira had stellar performances, and afterwards met up with their friends and coworkers again. There is some photo evidence of this meeting. At this stage, Aleta noted two things: 1) Ira ran a fast race, and 2) he was pretty cute. She decided that he was no longer her mortal enemy and might be perhaps a romantic interest. No numbers were requested or exchanged, so Aleta was left with one option: using a wingman. Connor, Meredith, and truly a humongous cast of characters (hi, Maggie and our entire summer kickball team!) were involved in the long burning pursuit of love by Aleta.</p>

<p>Fast forward to September 2016, when Ira asked Aleta on their first date. We went rock climbing and ate pizza (we still eat pizza, but have hung up the rock climbing shoes for now), and, as they say, the rest is history.</p>

<p><em>A note on language</em>: We decided early on in our situationship that we preferred the term “pals” to just about any other to describe our relationship. The term stuck, so you’ll likely be hearing us use it throughout the weekend.</p>

<p>In February 2022, we took a weekend trip to La Push, Washington, which is perched on the rocky coast of the Pacific Ocean, with a secret plan: to get engaged. We had been talking about getting engaged for months and wanted to take this step together. We agreed to propose with love letters to each other on Second Beach, which is Aleta’s most favorite beach in the entire world, in Olympic National Park at sunset.</p>

<p>As sunset drew closer, the storm clouds opened up and it began to rain. Undaunted, we put on our rain jackets and rain pants and hiked to the beach, finding it nearly deserted. Amid the rapidly descending twilight, we read our letters together, exchanged rings, and popped a bottle of champagne. It was a magical PNW afternoon.</p>

<p><em>A note on location</em>: La Push, Washington has been the site of many Greer family trips and Miller family reunions. In fact, Aleta’s parents, Ben and Sheree got engaged there in 1988! (We found this out after our secret trip and are still tickled by this fun fact.)</p>

            <h3 id="why-were-getting-married-on-san-juan-island">Why we’re getting married on San Juan Island</h3>

<p>When we moved to Washington State (Aleta’s home state) in 2021, we took every opportunity to explore the natural beauty of all corners of the state. One of our favorite trips that first year in Washington was a bikepacking trip to San Juan Island for Ira’s birthday. We took our bikes on to the ferry, cycled around the island, ate oysters, camped under the stars, snacked on picnic benches, looked for whales, and looped back to the ferry – all of which added up to an unbelievable weekend getaway.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2022 when we began looking for wedding venues: we wanted to choose a place that felt special to us, showcased the beauty of the Pacific Northwest, and allowed us, along with our friends and family, an opportunity to relax and celebrate together. San Juan Island and Saltwater Farm immediately came to mind. San Juan Island is a truly unique and gorgeous part of Washington State – the island is home to a rich history and incredible nature (from eagles to orcas to red tailed foxes!) as well as some quirky bits too – and we hope that you are able to explore it and fall in love with this part of our home state, too!</p>

<p><em>A note on logistics</em>: San Juan Island is not the easiest place to get to! More details on our travel page, but please know that getting here will require some advance planning (and time investment). Our wish is for you to think about this wedding like a vacation, if you’re able, and we really encourage you to take some time to enjoy the island and explore Washington in addition to celebrating our wedding with us. We think this place is really special and we’re so excited to share it with you – but also understand if you are not able to join since it can be quite the journey to get here.</p>
