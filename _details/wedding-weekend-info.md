We’re excited to have you all with us on San Juan Island in August 2024! San Juan Island is pretty remote, so we’re hoping that you’ll be able to take some time to enjoy the journey to the island and bask in what locals call “island time.” We’re planning to have a full weekend of casual, serious, and rowdy events. 

There's a lot to do on San Juan Island and we want to make sure everyone enjoys all that the island has to offer! We’re hoping to organize some group activities for wedding attendees (including some activities that require advanced reservations/guides/ tours). If you're interested in any of those options (like whale watching or kayaking), **please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeunoBDLhP2mxeV1VxvEr4KCjSYWpOzsJ_99im0C-GEZOb9FA/viewform)**, so we can get a sense of interest and numbers.
