We’ll have official wedding-related events from the afternoon of Friday, August 9 through the morning of Sunday, August 11. **We recommend arriving no later than Thursday, August 8** to kickstart your SJI weekend, however, since weekend travel can get hectic. We’ll be on the island by then, too - come hang out with us! 

*Note*: We plan to organize some group tours throughout the weekend to help explore the island and surrounding area – we’ll be in touch with details on possible whale watching cruises, kayaking, or other adventures.
