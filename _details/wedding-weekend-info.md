We’ll have official wedding-related events from the afternoon of Friday, August 9, 2024 through the morning of Sunday, August 11, 2024. **We recommend arriving no later than Thursday, August 8, 2024** to kickstart your San Juan Island (SJI) weekend, since weekend travel can get hectic and/or delayed. We’ll be on the island by Thursday too, so come hang out with us! 

*Note*: We plan to organize some group tours throughout the weekend to help explore the island and surrounding area – we’ll be in touch with details on possible whale watching cruises, kayaking, or other adventures.
