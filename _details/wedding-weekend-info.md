We’re excited to have you all with us on San Juan Island in August 2024! San Juan Island is pretty remote, so we’re hoping that you’ll be able to take some time to enjoy the journey to the island and bask in what locals call “island time.” We’re planning to have a full weekend of casual, serious, and rowdy events. 

There's a lot to do on San Juan Island and we want to make sure everyone enjoys all that the island has to offer! We’re hoping to organize some group activities for wedding attendees (including some activities that require advanced reservations/guides/ tours). If you're interested in any of those options (like whale watching or kayaking), **please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeunoBDLhP2mxeV1VxvEr4KCjSYWpOzsJ_99im0C-GEZOb9FA/viewform)**, so we can get a sense of interest and numbers.

## Thursday, August 8

## Friday, August 9
#### Optional Group Activity Options
##### Kayaking
We set up a 4 hour (2.5 hours on the water) kayak tour with [SeaQuest Kayak Tours](https://sea-quest-kayak.com/) for our wedding guests (unfortunately we won't be able to join since we'll be on a family whale watch) on Friday, August 9th from 10:30 am - 2:30 pm. It's $147 a person (with taxes and 6% credit card fee) and you can [sign up at this link](https://fareharbor.com/embeds/book/sea-quest-kayak/items/409408/availability/1486395850/book/?full-items=yes). Make sure you mention you are on the custom tour with Ira's wedding. Please note: the link says 10:30 - 1:30, but that's just a system limitation on their end.

If you are interested in a [bioluminescent tour](https://sea-quest-kayak.com/kayaking-san-juan-islands/bioluminescence-kayak-tours/) or longer [6 hour tour](https://sea-quest-kayak.com/kayaking-san-juan-islands/1-day-san-juan-kayaking-trips/) (which they highly recommend) please feel free to sign up for that instead!

Join us for an evening of wedding celebrations. We’ll have a ceremony on the picturesque ceremony lawn and then walk to the barn to celebrate in style. Please try to arrive by 3:45 pm. There will be a shuttle available from town to bring guests to and from Saltwater Farm.

***Dress**: The dress code is PNW party (cocktail or semi-formal is fine, and anything nicer than jeans preferred). Of note, the walk between the ceremony site and the reception is a bit over a quarter mile of gravel road. If you plan to wear heels, please consider a chunky heel or wedges.*

##### Ira's Big Bowling Birthday Bash

This isn't just any after party, it's Ira's Big Bowling Birthday Bash! Ira has been joking about having a bowling birthday party for two years and we thought - what better time to hold it than directly after our wedding. We'll have a shuttle taking guests from Saltwater Farm to JP's, which is right in Friday Harbor. The shuttle will also take folks home from JP's as well. We tested our JP's in May and had a blast - there's bowling, arcade games, pool, music, a gathering space, and a bar. We hope you'll join us!

#### Sendoff Grab and Go Brunch
######  9:30 am | TBD park

Whew! We’re hungry for baked goods, are you? We’ll gather outside near Friday Harbor for some bites as we compare notes about the best dance moves from the night before.
