We’re excited to have you all with us on San Juan Island in August 2024! San Juan Island is pretty remote, so we’re hoping that you’ll be able to take some time to enjoy the journey to the island and bask in what locals call “island time.” We’re planning to have a full weekend of casual, serious, and rowdy events.

Join us for an evening of wedding celebrations. We’ll have a ceremony on the picturesque ceremony lawn and then walk to the barn to celebrate in style. Please try to arrive by 3:45 pm. There will be a shuttle available from town to bring guests to and from Saltwater Farm. See the [shuttle schedule](https://www.strawberriesandoysters.com/transportation/#shuttle-schedule) for more details.

***Dress**: The dress code is PNW party (cocktail or semi-formal is great, and anything nicer than jeans preferred). Of note, the walk between the ceremony site and the reception is a bit over a quarter mile of gravel road. If you plan to wear heels, please consider a chunky heel or wedges.*

##### Ceremony

The ceremony will be outside on the ceremony lawn. Please bring a pair of shades and some sunscreen in case of sun!

######  11:00 pm - later | [JP's](https://www.jpsrestaurantbar.com/)
This isn't just any after party, it's Ira's Big Bowling Birthday Bash! Ira has been joking about having a bowling birthday party for two years and we thought - what better time to hold it than directly after our wedding. We'll have a shuttle taking guests from Saltwater Farm to JP's, which is right in Friday Harbor. The shuttle will also take folks home from JP's as well. See the [shuttle schedule](https://www.strawberriesandoysters.com/transportation/#shuttle-schedule) for more details.

We bowled a few frames at JP's in May and had a blast - there's bowling, arcade games, pool, music, a gathering space, and a bar. We hope you'll join us!

######  9:30 am | Fairweather Park (right by the ferry dock) [204 Front St, Friday Harbor, WA 98250](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fr389fbrZwoEPvrP9)

Whew! We’re hungry for baked goods, are you? We’ll gather outside near the ferry dock in Friday Harbor for some bites as we compare notes about the best dance moves from the night before. You'll be able to grab a bite before hopping on the ferry or float plane or however else you're getting off the island!
