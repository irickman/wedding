We are so incredibly excited to celebrate our wedding with you on San Juan Island! Truly, what we want more than anything is for you to have a good time with us during our wedding weekend.

However, we’ve been asked about our registry and have honestly had a difficult time with the idea. We’ve had far more conversation about it than almost any other decision we’ve made for our wedding and covered ground such as the ethics of asking for gifts, the privilege of not needing them, what it means to accept gifts with grace, and some light research on the origin of registries and how they reinforced gender roles in marriage.

So, we asked for advice from some of you and it was suggested that we: 
1. Make a registry, because if we didn’t have one, people’s denominational and non-denominational compulsions would lead them to give us a gift anyways.
2. Only ask for things we’d actually want and don’t feel pressure to put anything we aren’t absolutely certain we’ll love, on there.

So after some further discussion and an increasing realization that waiting wasn’t making anything better, we offer the following gifting ideas:

#### Registries
We found some things we would deeply appreciate receiving from [Williams Sonoma](https://www.williams-sonoma.com/registry/n6c62rxlrg/registry-list.html) and [REI](https://www.rei.com/lists/418427059). If you need our address when you check out, please feel free to text us.
#### Charitable Donations
The PNW has really become our home (always was for Aleta ;)) and we care about the community where we live. We’d be highly honored if you made a donation on our behalf to the [Ballard Food Bank](https://www.ballardfoodbank.org/donate) (in our neighborhood) or the [Washington Trails Association](https://give.wta.org/give/561682/#!/donation/checkout) (the trails we frequent).
#### Honeymoon Fund
We are planning to go on an adventurous, but relaxing honeymoon in Scandinavia, full of great food, lagöm vibes, majestic beauty, and hopefully some quality orca time in Norway. If you’d like to [support our trip](https://withjoy.com/aleta-and-ira/registry?pid=fa5fc6d1-5566-4d62-93e7-5bf775829a59), we’d appreciate it. 
#### House Fund
We absolutely love our current rental and feel like we have a great setup, but eventually it’d be nice to have the freedom to change the cabinets to a style of our choosing and place the refrigerator in a location that allows the freezer door to fully open, so we can do things like stuff more tuna filets in there. We aspire to own a home to do just that, even if it means we’d be on the hook for fixing the sink if it breaks or replacing the HVAC unit when it goes bust.
