Our preferred way to get to San Juan Island is via [Washington State Ferry](https://www.amli.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-the-washington-state-ferry-system), which requires getting to Anacortes, Washington (about 1.5 hours north of Seattle, depending on traffic – via car or shuttle) where you can walk, bike, or drive on to the ferry. 

##### Walk on

If you are comfortable walking on to the ferry (which means you will need to carry your luggage), you just need to get to Anacortes. We are happy to help organize carpools or there is also a [shuttle](https://airporter.com/shuttle/schedules/anacortes-san-juan-islands/) that picks up at both airports and downtown Seattle. You can also bike on to the ferry (like we did back in 2021). Again, we’re happy to coordinate carpools for luggage or people if you decide to walk or bike. You do not need an advance reservation if you plan to walk on or bike on to the ferry (though you will need to arrive 45 minutes prior to your preferred sailing time to buy a ticket). 

##### Drive on

**If you plan to drive on to the ferry, you will need a [reservation](https://secureapps.wsdot.wa.gov/Ferries/Reservations/Vehicle/default.aspx)**. 
Washington State Ferry reservations become available at 7 am PT in blocks released:
* two months prior to sailing
* two weeks prior to sailing
* two days prior to sailing

If you are driving onto the ferry, you **must arrive 1 hour before your ferry's scheduled departure**. Don't worry though, we will be in touch via email, text, and on this very website with the when, how, and what to do if you plan to drive.
