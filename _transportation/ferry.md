Our preferred way to get to San Juan Island is via [Washington State Ferry](https://www.amli.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-the-washington-state-ferry-system), which requires getting to Anacortes, Washington (about 1.5 hours north of Seattle, depending on traffic – via car or shuttle) where you can walk, bike, or drive on to the ferry. 

##### Walk on

If you are comfortable walking on to the ferry (which means you will need to carry your luggage), you just need to get to Anacortes. We are happy to help organize carpools or there is also a [shuttle](https://airporter.com/shuttle/schedules/anacortes-san-juan-islands/) that picks up at both airports and downtown Seattle. You can also bike on to the ferry (like we did back in 2021). Again, we’re happy to coordinate carpools for luggage or people if you decide to walk or bike. You do not need an advance reservation if you plan to walk on or bike on to the ferry (though you will need to arrive 45 minutes prior to your preferred sailing time to buy a ticket). 

##### Drive on

**If you plan to drive on to the ferry, you will need a [reservation](https://secureapps.wsdot.wa.gov/Ferries/Reservations/Vehicle/default.aspx)**. 
Washington State Ferry reservations become available at 7 am PT in blocks released:
* two months prior to the sailing season (April 16th)
* two weeks prior to sailing
* two days prior to sailing

If you are driving onto the ferry, you **must arrive 1 hour before your ferry's scheduled departure**. Don't worry though, we will be in touch via email, text, and on this very website with the when, how, and what to do if you plan to drive.

**What does a reservation mean?**

A reservation guarantees you a car spot on the selected ferry. You pay $19 for the reservation and pay the rest of the fare when you arrive at the ferry terminal. You only need one reservation per car.

**Do I need my license plate information to book?**

No, you don’t need this info, so if you have a rental car you absolutely can reserve now.

**How much time should I factor in to get to the ferry terminal?** 

You need to arrive 1 hour in advance of your ferry departure time and the ferry terminal is about a 2 hour drive from the Seattle Airport (however it can take even longer depending on summer traffic). We recommend allowing plenty of extra time. If you're really early, Anacortes is a cute town to explore. The ferry terminal itself has a nice little beach walk, but there isn't much else to do there.

**Do I have to drive onto the ferry?**

No, you can also walk onto the ferry! You can park your car at the Anacortes ferry terminal and walk onto the ferry. You do not need a reservation for a walk-on. If you aren’t able to get a reservation beforehand, walking on is a great option! You will still be able to get around the island for the important events but may have a little less flexibility to explore.

**What happens if I miss my reservation?**

Remember to arrive one hour in advance!! Each boat has a small amount of drive-up availability. When reservations don’t arrive early enough, they start opening availability to drive-up cars. You can try to get a drive-up spot on a later ferry or you can park your car and walk on, but note the time between some ferry departures.

**Can I make a ferry reservation for a different sized car than the one I'm driving?**

Unfortunately, no. You need to make a reservation for the size of vehicle you will be driving or they will not honor it and will send you into the standby line.
