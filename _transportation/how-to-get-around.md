If you’re staying in Friday Harbor, there is a lot to do that does not require a car. There is a [bus](https://www.sanjuantransit.com/schedules.html) on the island as well as [moped](https://susiesmopeds.com/) and bike rentals that can transport you between sights fairly seamlessly. We will also have a shuttle between Friday Harbor and the venue for wedding-related activities.

**There is very limited taxi service and no rideshare service. If you are interested in using a taxi, please let us know so that we can help you make a reservation.**

However, if you are staying outside of Friday Harbor, it may help to have a set of wheels, such as a car or bike, to get between places. Again, we’re happy to help set up carpools too!
