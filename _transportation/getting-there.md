Cue the planes, trains, boats, and automobiles!! San Juan Island is located in the northwest corner of Washington State – in fact, you can almost see Canada from our wedding venue. Our goal is for your travel here to be as painless (and fun!!) as possible. We love an adventure – especially when it involves island hopping – and we hope you do too. 

Let’s talk about getting to the island. Like booking accommodations, travel to San Juan Island is best reserved in advance (just not quite as far in advance).

If you’re traveling from out of state, you can fly into SeaTac (Seattle/Tacoma) or Paine Field (Everett). SeaTac is the larger of the two airports with the widest array of flight options. Paine Field is much smaller but technically closer to the venue. We may recommend flying through SeaTac to ensure that any travel issues can be mitigated more quickly, but Paine Field may be a good option for folks who are able to fly directly there. 

*Note*: If you are flying into Washington, we suggest arriving by Thursday, August 8 and departing late Sunday, August 11 — or even Monday, August 12. From either airport, it is still a lengthy drive and an hourlong boat ride or a short second flight to get to and from San Juan Island. We’d love for you to avoid travel stress while you’re here for our wedding!

If you are coming in from out of town, you may want a rental car if you are planning to do more than attend wedding activities. We also are hoping to organize shuttles as needed/appropriate – more to come on that. 

Once you’re on the ground in Washington, there are a few options to get to San Juan Island.
