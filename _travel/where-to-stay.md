San Juan Island is a small community with limited hotels, bed and breakfasts, and AirBNBs / VRBOs. We've compiled a [detailed list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n52Ke17liRPAs8_b8AHzvC6Rj9lg6lK8gqYk3QvdQLw/edit?usp=sharing) (also available below) of places to stay and provide additional updates on this page. We recommend taking a look at the options on the island and booking a place that is in your price range for your preferred dates early. Most places on the island have flexible cancellation policies since it is so popular for summer travel. 

**The most important thing**: if you plan to attend the wedding (or are pretty sure you may be able to come, or are even *thinking* about joining us), it is important to book your accommodations as soon as possible. 

Our venue, [Saltwater Farm](https://goo.gl/maps/xVvPcQgtesfrEC8f7), is located just outside of Friday Harbor, Washington. We recommend staying in or near Friday Harbor to minimize commute time to various activities. There are a limited number of two person Airstreams available for rent and an option to camp as well. If you are interested in either of those options, please fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/rk5GJrtrFuMh1oZR9), otherwise San Juan Island is relatively small and full of hidden gems, so searching farther afield can be fun too!

We are also very happy to help folks search for places to stay so reach out to us if you have any questions!
