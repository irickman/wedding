Our venue, [Saltwater Farm](https://goo.gl/maps/xVvPcQgtesfrEC8f7), is located just outside of Friday Harbor, Washington. We recommend staying in or near Friday Harbor to minimize commute time to various activities. There are a limited number of two person Airstreams available for rent on property as well, but San Juan Island is relatively small and full of hidden gems, so searching farther afield can be fun too!

Often this is where you’d see a room block or something similar, but San Juan Island doesn’t have a lot of options that provide that service. We’re working to see if some of the smaller hotels or bed and breakfasts may be able to offer a room block for us — that said, our sense is that this group of well-seasoned travelers may have more fun looking for and booking accommodations separately which is why we’re intentionally being a little open-ended here. 

We are very happy to help folks search for places to stay and hope to add more resources in the next month but wanted to start by encouraging you to explore first. In the meantime, the San Juan Island Visitors Bureau has a [comprehensive list](https://www.visitsanjuans.com/stay-san-juan-island) of places to stay on San Juan Island.
