##### Kayaking
We set up a 4 hour (2.5 hours on the water) kayak tour with [SeaQuest Kayak Tours](https://sea-quest-kayak.com/) for our wedding guests (unfortunately we won't be able to join since we'll be on a family whale watch) on Friday, August 9th from 10:30 am - 2:30 pm. It's $147 a person (with taxes and 6% credit card fee) and you can [sign up at this link](https://fareharbor.com/embeds/book/sea-quest-kayak/items/409408/availability/1486395850/book/?full-items=yes). Make sure you mention you are on the custom tour with Ira's wedding. Please note: the link says 10:30 - 1:30, but that's just a system limitation on their end.

If you are interested in a [bioluminescent tour](https://sea-quest-kayak.com/kayaking-san-juan-islands/bioluminescence-kayak-tours/) or longer [6 hour tour](https://sea-quest-kayak.com/kayaking-san-juan-islands/1-day-san-juan-kayaking-trips/) (which they highly recommend) please feel free to sign up for that instead!

#### The rest of the island
We’ll take the rest of our sightseeing cues from [San Juan Island’s Scenic Byway](https://www.visitsanjuans.com/san-juan-islands-scenic-byway-route-2011.pdf), which circumnavigates most of the island:

From Friday Harbor, head south to [American Camp at San Juan Island National Historical Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JwLuWVvNnQpYr64r7). This park is huge with forests, beaches, and prairies to explore. You'll likely spot some bald eagles and red foxes while you're there!  

Next, head west to [Lime Kiln Point State Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CmaC7JhZvStNMUUm6) (aka Whale Watch Park). This is a scenic spot that is supposedly one of the best places to see whales from shore (we have yet to do so, but feeling lucky for 2024)!

Continue north toward Roche Harbor, with options to stop at [Krystal Acres Alpaca Farm](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dNw6T6mVzRtCh9NQA) (for petting cute alpacas), [English Camp](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZbZfFLTJ1riuSveYA) (a smaller part of San Juan Island National Historical Park, but equally interesting for history of the [Pig War](https://www.strawberriesandoysters.com/more/)), and the [Sculpture Park at Westcott Bay](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TNZmM1aEs8P29gAu6) (a quirky, artsy spot to stretch your legs just outside of Roche Harbor). Additionally, along this route is [Westcott Bay Shellfish Co.](https://www.westcottbayshellfish.com/), a delightful place to spend the afternoon, eating seafood and sipping cold beverages.  

place to load up on road trip (or bike ride!) snacks. If you’re there on a Saturday or Sunday and like cider or gin, we also recommend a tasting at [San Juan Island Distillery](https://www.sanjuanislanddistillery.com/?utm_source=VisitSanJuans&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=VisitSanJuans%20Referral). They also do tastings on Fridays if you just let them know in advance!  

If you’re feeling adventurous and want to stretch your legs again, there is also a tiny, adorable county park on the northeastern side of the island called [Reuben Tarte County Park](https://goo.gl/maps/gK33Ks7xAiLjEQXV7). We recommend it as a picnic location and, potentially, whale watching (we saw whales here last time we were on SJI)!  

Head back south toward Friday Harbor to conclude your tour of the island. If you need to stock up on libations, we suggest a stop at [San Juan Vineyard](https://www.sanjuanvineyard.com/) (also where Aleta’s sister Ara celebrated her engagement over 20 years ago)!
