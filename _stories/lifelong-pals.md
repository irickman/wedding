### How we decided to become lifelong pals

In February 2023, we took a weekend trip to La Push*, Washington, a quiet town perched on the rocky coast of the Pacific Ocean and the perfect place to quietly get engaged. We had been talking about taking this next step for months and it was really important that our engagement reflect the nature of our relationship. So we decided to propose to each other, by writing love letters, then reading them at sunset on Second Beach in Olympic National Park, Aleta’s most favorite place in the entire world.

As sunset drew closer, the storm clouds opened up and it began to rain. Undaunted, we put on our rain jackets and rain pants, then hiked to a deserted Second Beach, to find a layered, but lovely, gray sky. Seated on massive driftwood logs, amid the rapidly descending twilight, we read our letters together, exchanged rings, and popped a bottle of champagne. It was a magnificent PNW evening. 

\**A note on location*: La Push, Washington has been the site of many Greer family trips and Miller family reunions. In fact, Aleta’s parents, Ben and Sheree got engaged there in 1988! (We found this out after our engagement trip and are still tickled by this fun fact.)
