### How we decided to become lifelong pals

In February 2022, we took a weekend trip to La Push, Washington, which is perched on the rocky coast of the Pacific Ocean, with a secret plan: to get engaged. We had been talking about getting engaged for months and wanted to take this step together. We agreed to propose with love letters to each other on Second Beach, which is Aleta’s most favorite beach in the entire world, in Olympic National Park at sunset. 

As sunset drew closer, the storm clouds opened up and it began to rain. Undaunted, we put on our rain jackets and rain pants and hiked to the beach, finding it nearly deserted. Amid the rapidly descending twilight, we read our letters together, exchanged rings, and popped a bottle of champagne. It was a magical PNW afternoon. 

*A note on location*: La Push, Washington has been the site of many Greer family trips and Miller family reunions. In fact, Aleta’s parents, Ben and Sheree got engaged there in 1988! (We found this out after our secret trip and are still tickled by this fun fact.)
