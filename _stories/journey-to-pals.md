## How We Became Pals

Aleta and Ira met one preternaturally cold morning in April 2016 before the George Washington Parkway Classic, an annual 10 mile run that takes place between Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington, and Old Town Alexandria, in the northern Virginia suburbs. Aleta planned to run with some friends from Georgetown (hello, Connor, Meredith, Michelle, and Patrick!! They’ll be at the wedding), and Ira was planning to run with some coworkers (that’d be Connor). Naturally, this group of twentysomethings gathered to keep warm and chat ahead of the race. Aleta and Ira were introduced, Ira promptly declared his dislike for Aleta’s running group, and Aleta decided he was her mortal enemy. 

During the race, both Aleta and Ira had stellar performances, and afterwards met up with their friends and coworkers again. There is some photo evidence of this meeting. At this stage, Aleta noted two things: 1) Ira ran a fast race, and 2) he was pretty cute. She decided that he was no longer her mortal enemy and might be perhaps a romantic interest. No numbers were requested or exchanged, so Aleta was left with one option: using a wingman. Connor, Meredith, and truly a humongous cast of characters (hi, Maggie and our entire summer kickball team!) were involved in the long burning pursuit of love by Aleta. 

Fast forward to September 2016, when Ira asked Aleta on their first date. We went rock climbing and ate pizza (we still eat pizza, but have hung up the rock climbing shoes for now), and, as they say, the rest is history. 

*A note on language*: We decided early on in our situationship that we preferred the term “pals” to just about any other to describe our relationship. The term stuck, so you’ll likely be hearing us use it throughout the weekend.
