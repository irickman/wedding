### Why we're getting married on San Juan Island

When we moved to Washington State (homecoming for Aleta) in 2021, we took every opportunity to explore the abundance of natural beauty in the region. One of our favorite trips that first year was a bikepacking trip to San Juan Island for Ira’s birthday. We biked onto the ferry, cycled around the island, slurped oysters, camped under the stars, kayaked in the Haro Strait, gawked at bald eagles in flight, popped champagne on a picnic bench, searched the sea for whales, and looped back to the ferry – it was an unbelievable weekend getaway. 

Fast forward to 2023 when we began looking for wedding venues: we wanted to choose a place that felt special to us, showcased the beauty of the Pacific Northwest, and allowed us, along with our friends and family, an opportunity to relax and celebrate together. San Juan Island and Saltwater Farm immediately came to mind. San Juan Island is a truly unique and gorgeous part of Washington State – the island is home to a rich history and incredible nature (from eagles to orcas to red tailed foxes!) as well as some quirky bits too – and we hope that you are able to explore it and fall in love with this part of our home state, too!

*A note on logistics*: San Juan Island is not the easiest place to get to! More details on our travel page, but please know that getting here will require some advance planning (and time investment). Our wish is for you to think about this wedding like a vacation, if you’re able, and we really encourage you to take some time to enjoy the island and explore Washington in addition to celebrating our wedding with us. We think this place is really special and we’re so excited to share it with you – but also understand if you are not able to join since it can be quite the journey to get here.
