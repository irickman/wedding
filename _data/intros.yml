description: We’re excited to have you all with us on San Juan Island in August 2024! San Juan Island is pretty remote, so we’re hoping that you’ll be able to take some time to enjoy the journey to the island and bask in what locals call “island time.” We’re planning to have a full weekend of casual, serious, and rowdy events – many of which are listed below – please check back often as we’ll be sure to make updates to timing or locations here as we finalize details for our great big PNW wedding.
