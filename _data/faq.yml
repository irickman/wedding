- question: Why is this website called strawberries and oysters?
  answer: |
    When we started our initial planning for the wedding, we asked ourselves: what are non-negotiables for the celebration? For Ira, it was strawberries, and for Aleta, it was oysters – both are some of our very favorite things. We’re planning to have both foods at our wedding and we hope you’ll be able to sample some of the finest PNW options of each.
- question: How do I RSVP for this fabulous weekend?
  answer: |
    We’ll be in touch to share an RSVP link before the end of the year!

- question: Can I bring my kids?
  answer: |
    Yes! We love your little ones and would be honored to have them boogie with us at our wedding. Please be sure to include them in your RSVP so we can appropriately account for attendees.

- question: What will the weather be like?
  answer: |
     Summer in the San Juan Islands is idyllic and, indeed, one of the reasons we wanted to get married there! During the day, highs will likely be in the 70s, with lows in the 50s, so as we say in Washington, pack layers and a rain jacket, just in case!!

- question: Will the wedding events occur indoors or outdoors?
  answer: |
    Most activities will be outside, though we will have access to rain sites (if needed) and parts of the reception may have an indoor option (but remember, layers)! Please bring shoes that you can walk in, as you will have to traverse some sections of unpaved ground (a lawn, garden, and gravel pathway) at various points throughout the weekend.

- question: What is the dress code for the weekend?
  answer: |
    We’ll provide additional information on dress code as we finalize our slate of wedding events and adventures, but expect that it will range from PNW chic (think: flannels, fleeces, and jeans) to cocktail (you know: fun dresses, jumpsuits, and slacks).

- question: Where is your registry? Can I send you a gift?
  answer: |
    We’ll add more information on the website soon regarding a <a href="https://www.strawberriesandoysters.com/registry/">registry </a> and gifting, but please know that your presence at our wedding weekend is present enough!    

- question: What's the best way to contact you if I have additional questions?
  answer: |
    Aleta and Ira are both available via text, phone call, or our new shared email: <a href="mailto: strawberriesandoysters@gmail.com">strawberriesandoysters@gmail.com.</a>
