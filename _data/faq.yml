- question: Why is this website called strawberries and oysters?
  answer: |
    When we started our initial planning for the wedding, we asked ourselves: what are non-negotiables for the celebration? For Ira, it was strawberries, and for Aleta, it was oysters – both are some of our very favorite things. We’re planning to have both foods at our wedding and we hope you’ll be able to sample some of the finest PNW options of each.
- question: How do I RSVP for this fabulous weekend?
  answer: |
    Check out the <a href="https://www.strawberriesandoysters.com/rsvp/">rsvp link</a> to RSVP! Feel free to RSVP whenever you're ready. You can also edit your RSVP if needed.

- question: Can I bring my kids?
  answer: |
    Yes! We love your little ones and would be honored to have them boogie with us at our wedding. Please be sure to include them in your RSVP so we can appropriately account for attendees.

- question: What will the weather be like?
  answer: |
     Summer in the San Juan Islands is idyllic and, indeed, one of the reasons we wanted to get married there! During the day, highs will likely be in the 70s, with lows in the 50s, so as we say in Washington, pack layers and a rain jacket, just in case!!

- question: Will the wedding events occur indoors or outdoors?
  answer: |
    Most activities will be outside, though we will have access to rain sites (if needed) and parts of the reception may have an indoor option (but remember, layers)! Please bring shoes that you can walk in, as you will have to traverse some sections of unpaved ground (a lawn, garden, and gravel pathway) at various points throughout the weekend.

- question: What is the dress code for the weekend?
  answer: |
    Check out the <a href="https://www.strawberriesandoysters.com/schedule/">weekend schedule</a> for details, but for the wedding itself, wear PNW party (cocktail or semi-formal is fine, and anything nicer than jeans preferred).

- question: Where is your registry? Can I send you a gift?
  answer: |
    We’ll add more information on the website soon regarding a <a href="https://www.strawberriesandoysters.com/registry/">registry </a> and gifting, but please know that your presence at our wedding weekend is present enough!    

- question: What's the best way to contact you if I have additional questions?
  answer: |
    Aleta and Ira are both available via text, phone call, or our new shared email: <a href="mailto: strawberriesandoysters@gmail.com">strawberriesandoysters@gmail.com.</a>

- question: Which times should I book for the ferry?
  answer: |
    There’s a few options each day. The full schedule is here, but can be confusing to read. You’ll want to make sure you book one that starts in Anacortes and ends in Friday Harbor (and reversed for the return trip). Those options are listed below:

    Anacortes to Friday Harbor departure times 

    * 6:15 am
    * 9:05 am
    * 12 pm
    * 2:00 pm
    * 4:45 pm
    * 8:20 pm

    Friday Harbor to Anacortes departure times
    * 8:10 am
    * 11:00 am
    * 1:55 pm
    * 2:25 pm
    * 3:40 pm
    * 6:30 pm

- question: What does a ferry reservation mean?
  answer: A reservation guarantees you a car spot on the selected ferry. You pay $19 for the reservation and pay the rest of the fare when you arrive at the ferry terminal. You only need one reservation per car.

- question: Do I need my license plate information to book a ferry?
  answer: No, you don’t need this info, so if you have a rental car you absolutely can reserve now.

- question: How much time should I factor in to get to the ferry terminal?
  answer: You need to arrive 1 hour in advance of your ferry departure time and the ferry terminal is about a 2 hour drive from the Seattle Airport (however it can take even longer depending on summer traffic). We recommend allowing plenty of extra time. If you're really early, Anacortes is a cute town to explore. The ferry terminal itself has a nice little beach walk, but there isn't much else to do there.

- question: Do I have to drive onto the ferry?
  answer: No, you can also walk onto the ferry! You can park your car at the Anacortes ferry terminal and walk onto the ferry. You do not need a reservation for a walk-on. If you aren’t able to get a reservation beforehand, walking on is a great option! You will still be able to get around the island for the important events but may have a little less flexibility to explore.

- question: What happens if I miss my ferry reservation?
  answer: Remember to arrive one hour in advance!! Each boat has a small amount of drive-up availability. When reservations don’t arrive early enough, they start opening availability to drive-up cars. You can try to get a drive-up spot on a later ferry or you can park your car and walk on, but note the time between some ferry departures.

- question: Can I make a ferry reservation for a different sized car than the one I'm driving?
  answer: Unfortunately, no. You need to make a reservation for the size of vehicle you will be driving or they will not honor it and will send you into the standby line.
