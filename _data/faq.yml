- question: What time should I arrive to the ceremony?
  answer: |
    Feel free to arrive any time after 3pm! The grounds of the property will be open, though we’ll ask folks to stay close to the Ceremony lawn.

- question: Will the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception take place indoors or outdoors?
  answer: |
    Everything will be largely outside, though we will have access to rain sites (if needed). Parts of dinner and dancing will occur in an indoor-outdoor space. And yes, there are flush toilets!

- question: What will the weather be like?
  answer: |
    August in the San Juan Islands is idyllic (and, indeed, one of the reasons we wanted to get married there)!

- question: How do I get to the wedding venue? Will transportation be provided?
  answer: |
    The venue is 1.5 miles outside of Friday Harbor. While it is possible to walk there, we recommend making plans to drive back since island roads are dark and cars drive fast! We’re considering a shuttle into downtown Friday Harbor.

- question: Is there parking available at the wedding venue?
  answer: |
    There is limited parking on site, and we recommend carpooling if possible. We will likely set up a shuttle from downtown Friday Harbor if there is enough interest.

- question: Can I bring my kids?
  answer: |
    Yes! We love your little ones, and would be honored to have them boogie with us at our wedding.

- question: When is the RSVP deadline?
  answer: |
    Please RSVP by June 30, 2024 (though we’d love to know if you plan to attend sooner)!

- question: How will you communicate any updated information and/or changes before the wedding?
  answer: |
    Please plan to check this website for the latest information.

- question: What's the best way to contact you if I have additional questions?
  answer: |
    Aleta and Ira are both available via text and phone call. Please feel free to call with questions/concerns/etc. We want to make sure that you have a wonderful time on this trip!
